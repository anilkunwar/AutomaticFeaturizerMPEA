# AutomaticFeaturizerMPEA
AutomaticFeaturizerMPEA.pynb is an interactive computational environment developed in python programming language to compute the properties of Multi Principal-component Element Alloy (MPEA) system .

The code present in the .ipynb file is capable of firstly extracting composition feature from the name of MPEA and then compute thermodynamic/physical and chemical properties using these composition features. The properties that can be automatically calculated and featurized by the code are: 
1. Valance Electron Concentration
2. Average Melting Temperature
3. Enthalpy of Mixing
4. Entropy of Mixing
5. Electronegativity
6. Atomic size difference
7. Omega parameter  
8. 41 elemental composition

The primary source used for the calculation of these alloy properties are taken from two python libraries: "pymatgen" and "matminer". 

In the AutomaticFeaturizerMPEA.pynb file. A sample of MPEA "Ti0.8CoCrFeNiCu" is calculated as an example.

The python file is not only capable of calculating the alloy properties but also featurizes them along with the composition of the alloy and export it as a .csv file for further machine learning training process.

The repository consists of 2 .csv files:

1. "MPEA_data.csv" file is the collected observations of MPEAs with their phase information for which we want to calculate their properties and featurize them.
2. "Featurized_MPEA.csv" file is the processed ready to train file which consists of MPEA, their properties and composition featurized in special order. It is the final file generated by the AutomaticFeaturizerMPEA.pynb python file.
